# Summary of the software

## Description

Our application is a Slack Bot that will help in management of teams in multiple ways. The bot will have multiple features that will help in the management of teams (which can be extended easily).
The problem we are trying to solve is to create a "helper" that can help manage the teams in Slack better.
For example, one feature that we are intending to complete is the feature to send a "kudos" to another user, which is like a "thank you" message.
This command can be used by Managers of a certain work space to ensure that an employee does receive acknowledgements when they do something beyond expectations.

## Existing solutions

Currently, there are various Slack Apps that are available in the official Slack App. However, none of them are able to provide the features that we are intending to provide.
For example, we want to collect "kudos" for different users, so that we can provide a report to the managers of the workspace to see who has been receiving the most "kudos" in the workspace.
Furthermore, the "kudos" that the users are receiving can also be tied with an alignment with company values, which can reflect an employee's performance in the workspace.

# Subgroup formation

We have decided to split ourselves into 3 subgroups, with 1-2 people in each group.
