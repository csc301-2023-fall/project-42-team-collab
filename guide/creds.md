# Credentials used

This file will store all of the credentials that we have used for this project. 

# Group Email (Google) [BANNED]

**NOTE: This account is banned by Google and we no longer have access to it.**

This account is used to register for some of the services like Figma, but got flagged by Google, and after appealing for the account, we still did not regain access to it.

# Figma Account

This account is used for drafting our diagrams for the presentations and markdowns. 

Note: This account is registered while our email account is still working. So changing passwords & emails of this account might be a little bit difficult.

# Docker Hub Account

This account is used for Docker Hub to store our Docker image, which contains our entire codebase. 

Note: The account is a borrowed email from one of the group members. It is very likely that he will not be using Docker in a very long period of time, so the team picking this up can use the account for a bit. 

However, as Docker Hub accounts are very easy to register, it is recommended for you to register another account and follow the [main guide](main-guide.md) to setup Docker Hub.

# Azure Access

The main Azure account we have used is from one of our team member, and it is logged in using the UTORid sign in module. 

The Azure account is used for our Database, Docker container, and our PHP Web server. 

Therefore, it is extremely hard for us to share the credentials for this. In the [main guide](main-guide.md), there is a video that guides you to setup every component (Database, Docker container, and PHP Web Server). 

However, we will have our PostgreSQL Database up and running until the end of December.
